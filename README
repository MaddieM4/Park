Park is a package management system that uses source repositories as packages.

It abstracts some common features of repo systems, like git and Mercurial, into
a single command-line interface. You can actually commit and push changes from
park itself.

Park also includes auto-update controls which manage crontabs for individual
packages, which helps you maintain any kind of update schedule you could want.

Here is a summary of its usage:


	park +

		List all *explicitly installed* packages. On a fresh install of
		Cambria, the only installed package will be "cambria", as the
		dependencies form your entire system and are not explicitly
		installed. As you add more packages with the following command,
		they will be added to this list, which will make it trivially
		easy to manually (or throught a script) clean your system back
		to a fresh install state.

	park + packagename [otherpackage]

		Install a package to your system. You can install as many as
		you want with a single command, they're space-seperated.

	park + repolocation [as name]

		Install a package from a repo address. If no name is given,
		the folder name retrieved by the repo program will be used.
		If a name is given, then that will be used as the folder name
		in /src/pkg. Note that this can be mixed freely with other
		packages, and is really the same command as above, but showing
		off different features. 

		Also note that you can use the same name as an "official" 
		package in the park registry, as all official packages can be 
		accessed through "!name", where "name" is the name of the 
		package. So I could install some weird variant of Python as
		"python", but I'm still fully capable of referencing the "real"
		Python package as "!python" (as in, "park + !python"). You can
		think of non-! names as softlinks that point to their !
		counterparts unless overridden by custom packages. Using the
		same name twice will cause park to ask you if you want to 
		overwrite the existing custom package, which is the only way
		to install a new package to an existing override name (this
		will uninstall the old custom package).

		The "as" keyword also takes the official names of repos, so
		you can make a pseudonym for a package if it makes your life
		easier. This will duplicate the source code on your system, but
		allows you to more easily have two versions of a package side-
		by-side on your system. I could enter "park + ruby as newruby"
		to install the ruby package under the name "newruby", whether
		it was currently installed or not.

	park -

		Remove all installed packages that are neither explicitly
		installed nor dependencies of explicitly installed packages,
		equivalent to apt-get autoremove.

	park - packagename [otherpackage]

		Uninstall one or more packages. Does not support repo links.

	park x

		Update all your packages - this can be a very slow ordeal,
		and is the reason park includes a cron-based "rolling update"
		system.

	park x packagename [otherpackage]

		Update one or more packages. If you give it a repo link, it
		will use the repo's name (much like park + will), and this
		command also supports the "as" keyword. Any packages not already
		installed will be installed automatically.

		You can also use the "to" keyword for metapackages, to specify
		what version you want to set the package to. For example, 
		"park x python to 2.7", which will update the dependencies of
		the python package to contain only "python2.7" and attempt to
		update python. Trying to set to a version not specified in the
		metapackage will generate an error but not interfere in other
		updates.

	park /

		List all installed packages in a dependency tree.

	park / packagename

		List information about the package, "packagename".

	park / packagename property value

		Set the property "property" of package "packagename" to "value".

		Some example properties are "version" (which works the same as
		"park x packagename to value"), "auto" (which sets whether this
		package updates automatically or not), and "schedule" (which is
		a human-readable schedule description that usually follows the
		format of "every 14:20" or "every Tuesday" or "every Tuesday at
		14:20").

		This subcommand is the reason you can't list properties of
		multiple packages at once.

	park / packagename property

		Print out the current value of "property" for "packagename".

		Absolutely no frills, because really, it's the scripters who
		are gonna use this, mostly, and frills just make things
		complicated in a completely unnecessary fashion for them.
